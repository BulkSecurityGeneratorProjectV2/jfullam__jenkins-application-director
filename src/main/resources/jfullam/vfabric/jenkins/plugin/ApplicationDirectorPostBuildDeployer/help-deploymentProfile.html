	The application (blueprint) to deploy / provision.

	A search for an existing deployment for the select application and deployment profile will be performed.  If
	any are found, a teardown will be scheduled for the first one.  Ideally, a dedicated deployment profile will
	be created in Application Director when looking to achieve continuous provisioning.  There would only be one 
	deployment at any given time for that profile.
